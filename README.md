# Find the maximum of a list of numbers
## Aim:
To write a program to find the maximum of a list of numbers.
## Equipment’s required:
1.	Hardware – PCs
2.	Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner
## Algorithm:
1.	Get the list of marks as input
2.	Use the sort() function or max() function or use the for loop to find the maximum mark.
3.	Return the maximum value
## Program:

i)	# To find the maximum of marks using the list method sort.

def max_marks(marks):
    #Write your code here
    marks.sort()
    large = marks[-1]
    return large
max_marks([88, 67, 77, 93, 95, 11, 67, 89, 56, 89])

```

ii)	# To find the maximum marks using the list method max().

```
## Output:

### i)  Output of the maximum of marks using the list method sort.

## Result:
Thus the program to find the maximum of given numbers from the list is written and verified using python programming.
